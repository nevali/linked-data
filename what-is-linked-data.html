	  <h1>What <em>is</em> Linked Data?</h1>
	  <p>
		Much of the World Wide Web today is made up of linked <em>pages</em>:
		documents, usually written in HTML, which are uniquely identifiable,
		so that part of one document can link to another, even if the link is
		the only thing those two documents have in common.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Linked Data applies the principles and mechanics used to connect 
		documents intended for human consumption together on the Web to
		<em>data</em>—which is intended for software consumption.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		In order to make this possible, Linked Data is built upon a set of
		principles (most of which should be familiar ground for Web developers
		who have never even so much as dabbled with Linked Data):
	  </p>
	  <ol>
		<li>the unit of currency—the means by which everything is identified—is the URI;</li>
		<li>things work best when we’re all speaking the same language; and</li>
		<li>use the facilities HTTP provides for us.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
		Over the following short chapters, I’m going to take you through
		each of these principles in turn (and even if you decide not to publish
		Linked Data, you’ll find that they’re a good set of guidelines to work
		from for publishing on the Web in general).
